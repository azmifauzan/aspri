This is a test document for ASPRI document API testing.
It contains some sample text that will be processed and embedded.
The text should be chunked and vector embeddings should be created.
Later we can search for specific content in this document.
We can use this to test the document API endpoints.
The document API should support uploading, retrieving, updating, and deleting documents.
It should also support searching for documents using vector similarity.
This is implemented using langchain and sentence-transformers.
The embeddings are stored in MariaDB as binary data.
